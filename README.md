# pythonic_way_reading_file

# Description
The repo contains a module with a very small code (pythonic_readfile.py module). In that code you can find a pythonic way to read a file line by line by calling a function. Specifically, you want to read a file (e.g. file.txt) from a main function using a loop structure which in each loop you call another function to get a line from the file.

# Why this?
There are cases that you want to indepent if you are using a file or some string (e.g. when you are testing your code). Or you want to reduce a level of indentation.

# How ?
You have to use yield and to take care iter and next manually.
